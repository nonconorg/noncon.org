# raffle

the raffle will happen on sunday (or after that, as soon as i have written it).

### abstract

* use rust [seedableRng](https://rust-num.github.io/num/rand/trait.SeedableRng.html)
* predefine a block before it is mined.
* use that hash as seed.
* find x users, distribute devices.

more info, including a link to the raffle git and docs will follow here soon.
