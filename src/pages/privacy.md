## Privacy Notice

This page does not:

Collect personal data, load tracking scripts,
or use any other means of spying on its users


Since this page and the connecting databases were setup in about 12 hours,
we used
[typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)
to implement the form.

For now, we save all submitted forms in a google document.

This is expected to change very soon.

We will in no way try to correlate form inputs with ticket purchases

All purchasers of tickets will receive an non-personalized nft token.

This token will not be required for entry, ! just come !,
but will unlock some awesome goodies instead.
