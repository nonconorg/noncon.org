## <p>Not a Conference. Not a Conjob.</p>

It's not what you do or where you go, it's the friends you make along the way. Open source Blockchain projects celebrate permissionless innovation and self sovereignty. We subscribe to these values and support them flowing out into other social spaces. [Read More...](https://www.parallele.at/not-a-conference-not-a-conjob/)

### From meatspace to cyberspace

NonCon is an inclusive Safe Space. Please honour the [Parallele Polis Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.parallele.at/code-of-conduct/&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw0fLqBewS8z2AKFyutpMBPR) when participating in our virtual event venues in the same manner you would in meatspace. Moderators will kick / ban attendees who violate community standards of behaviour.

Since we are livestreaming the speakers to our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsF67FGXtv4lplQyQSPizbQ) utilizing [Open Broadcast Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Broadcaster_Software), we request that those who join do so with their cameras turned on, and microphones muted, for that true meatspace conference feeling. If you want to interact with our speakers live during their Q & A, or merely want to give them an audience to look at and consent to your face / voice to be recorded and broadcast on Youtube, join the appropriate track at [noncon.interspace.chat](https://noncon.interspace.chat) at the appropriate time.

Please remember to abide by [Video Conferencing Best Practices](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uit.stanford.edu/videoconferencing/best-practices&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw06KBcuZ83Nn15iI2LdHZJ_) to insure the best experience for the speaker, yourself, and your peers who are participating. Signal to the speakers that you will attend by subscribing to individual speaker events in the Google Calendar embedded below.

## Virtual Venues

There will be a lobby, and three rooms / tracks, each with individual livestreams, including the Parallele Polis, Cryptoeconomics Institute, and Metatrack. A calendar agenda for each of the rooms will be available here on our website before the event takes place so that you can plan which talks you want to participate in. The main topics are tilted towards community, development, and security, and inclusive of interests outside the Ethereum ecosystem
to include all cypherpunk and privacy focused individuals and communities.

### Youtube Livestream
