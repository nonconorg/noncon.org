## <p>Not a Conference.</p><p>Not a Conjob.</p>

We intend for NONCON 2020 to be much smaller in scope, cheaper,
and in general more community oriented than EDCON,
as well as tilting the main topics towards community, development, and security,
while also being more inviting to interests outside the Ethereum ecosystem
to include all cypherpunk and privacy focused individuals and communities.
Please bear with us in the coming weeks,
as this is very much last notice
and we will do our best to deliver an experience that proves fulfilling for its participants.
There might or might not be speakers, there might or might not be hackbounties,
but there will definitely be a place to hang out with peers
and do whatever it is ya wanna do together for four days in beautiful Vienna.
Open source Blockchain projects celebrate permissionless innovation and self sovereignty.
We subscribe to these values and support them flowing out into other social spaces.

## Looking Covid-19 in The Eye

<Img src="/img/in-the-eye.jpg"></Img>

It's the reason for the edcon cancellation after all.
We believe that public communication needs to shift from
[containment to coping](https://www.psandman.com/col/swineflu2.htm),
based on lessons learned from past viral infections.
Are we Crazy? Well, lets say we are willing to take a calculated risk.

Digital Natives travel widely to attend numerous conferences throughout the year,
yet we are observably not following COVID-19 preventative practices.

And yet, the motives to be pro-active about COVID-19 are simple.

We want to protect our teams, friends, and families.
We want to protect the wider community.
We want to protect the healthcare and social systems we rely on.

How do we plan to proceed with our conference?

### Things that we will provide:

EN 12054 certified
[Surgical hand sanitizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer#Surgical_hand_disinfection)
and Masks.
[(It\\\'s a cypherpunk event after all)](https://twitter.com/TheRealSmuggler/status/1203361366708494342?s=20)

### Sanitization Process

First, every attendee will be required to sanitize their hands.

Then, we will provide disinfectant for the masks.
You will hodl your mask,
our team will handle the disinfectant,
to prevent the bottle(s) from being our infection vector.

Those without a mask will get a bandana from us.

<Img class="center" src="/img/bandana.png"></Img>

We advise everyone to wear some kind of glasses or goggles. <DealWithIt state></DealWithIt>

After sanitizing your hands,
please make sure to cough into your elbow and not in your hands.

Try not to touch your eyes, pick your nose, suck your thumb.

Wash and/or sanitize your hands both **before and after** using the toilets

Please only touch people you touch on a regular basis anyways. No group cuddles, sorry.
